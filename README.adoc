Kniffel is a web-based version of the classic dice game, implemented with a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.
Users can register, log in, play the game, and track their scores.

== ðŸš€ Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

* Node.js v18 or higher
* PostgreSQL or SQLite (SQLite is default for local dev)
* npm (comes with Node.js)

=== Setup Instructions

. Clone the repository and navigate to the project:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <repo-url>
cd wvss_kniffel
----
. Setup the backend server:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd server
npm install
----
. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following content:
+
[source,env]
----
PORT=3001
SESSION_SECRET=supersecret
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
----
. Setup the database:
+
[source,bash]
----
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
----
. Start the backend server:
+
[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----
. Start the frontend dev server:

== ðŸŽ² Kniffel Rules & Scoring

* You play with 5 dice.
* Each turn allows up to 3 rolls.
* After each roll, you can keep any dice and re-roll the others.
* After rolling, you must select one unused scoring category.

=== Sections

* *Upper Section*: Ones through Sixes (sum of matching dice).
  ** Bonus: 35 points if total is 63 or higher.
* *Lower Section*: Combination-based categories.
